# Daniel's `Homelab`


**Hi! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)**

**I'm Daniel and I'm passionate about creating network services and network technologies. In short, I'm a Homelab nerd.**

This Repository **Ansible** contains all my ansible playbooks. Here you'll find notes, setups, and configurations for infrastructure, applications, networking, and more.

> :warning: Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this won’t always be the case.

I created them as free resources to be used in your specific use cases.

## Contribution

As this is my personal Homelab documentation, I don't accept any contributions. But feel free to fork this repository and use it for your own documentation.
